        <h2>Oh hello!<h2>
        <h3>This year I've decided that the easiest way
            to share my Xmas wishlist is by website <sup><sup>(Last year I tried email/
            dropbox but that was apparently too complicated)</sup></sup>. So here is
            my 3-minute website on what I want! I'm going to leave it up to anyone
            reading this to self organize.</h3> 
    </header>

    <main> 
        <p>Below is a running list of the items I would like ranked by <em>how much
            I want the item</em>. The scale is roughly logarithmic<sub>(base 2)</sub> - 
            so I want item #3 1/4th as much as I want item #1. I've tried to place 
            the best cost estimate that I can around each item, and listed a wide
            range of items. As usual, I'm thrilled if people pitch together to get
            one bigger gift than multiple smaller ones. 
            And God help you if you get me Megablocks instead of Lego. </p>

        <div>
            <p>Please note that this list is liable to change, and be updated. But I won't be removing
               anything from it. Rather, potentially appending and/or reorganizing items. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mouse (computer) ($10-$30):
                    </br><a href="http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=114&cp_id=11401&cs_id=1140101&p_id=11155&seq=1&format=2">Example</a> </li>
                
                <li>Kung Fu Slippers (~$10) Size 45EU (11US)

                    </br>Note that you don't need to buy the groupon: you can call them, they have my name
                       and measurements on file. They'll give the same price (they get more $ that way)</li>

                <li>'Pelican' case for laptop AND accessories like big headphones (laptop is 45cm on diagonal) ($~?):

                    </br>Alternatively, as I mostly need a Chef's knife (8") and a paring knife (3"), I'd be happy with higher quality of just those. </li>

                         “oh, ya, that’s totally what Brian meant by “very large”. 
                         Son, I mean 4’x6’ or larger. Even better. Buy a thing of Idea paint 
                         and a fibre glass sheet and paint that up, and give me the rest of the 
                         paint for when I buy a place and can do half of the house in it. </li>

                <li>Favi Mini-Keyboard ($~50). Yup, still want it, but it's no longer $20
