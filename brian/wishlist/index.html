        <h2>Well Hello Everyone!<h2>
        <h3>Since this worked out at least somewhat well last year, I'm posting 
            this wishlist online for anyone to view<sup><sup>(I'll even try and set up a viewable form so that you don't even have to interact with eachother!)</sup></sup>. So here is
            my 3-minute website on what I want! Please self-organize.</h3> 
    </header>

    <main> 
        <p>Below is a running list of the items I would like ranked by <em>how much
            I want the item</em>. The scale is roughly logarithmic<sub>(base 2)</sub> - 
            so I want item #3 1/4th as much as I want item #1. I've tried to place 
            the best cost estimate that I can around each item, and listed a wide
            range of items. As usual, I'm thrilled if people pitch together to get
            one bigger gift than multiple smaller ones. 
            And God help you if you get me Megablocks instead of Lego. </p>

        <div>
            <p>Please note that this list is liable to change, and be updated. But I won't be removing
               anything from it. Rather, potentially appending and/or reorganizing items. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mouse (computer) ($10-$30):
                    </br><a href="http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=114&cp_id=11401&cs_id=1140101&p_id=11155&seq=1&format=2">Example</a> </li>

                <li>Multimeter ($? like.. $40?)
                    </br>I need for testing electronics mostly, very rarely for larger things like car fusebox etc.
                    </br>(lost count of how many times I've thought "man. I should go buy one")
                    </br>Whichever one we got Grant last year is probably good...
                    </br>See <a href="https://toolsreviewer.com/top-10-best-multimeters/">here, I think</a></li>

                <li>'Pelican' case for laptop AND accessories like big headphones (laptop is 45cm on diagonal) ($~?):
                    </br><a href="http://www.pelican.com">Pelican</a>

                <li>A nice bottle of Sake ($?)</li>

                <li>Over-ear headphones (very specific here. they play via bone resonance. awesome):

                    </li>

                    </br>Probably best if someone from my generation does this</li>

                <li>Board games ($ = variable)
                    <br>Victor Tsang knows a lot about these... </li>
