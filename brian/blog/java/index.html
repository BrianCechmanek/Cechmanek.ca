				<h2>I have no programming experience. <br>
					Let's make that clear: I don't know what I'm doing. <br>
					This is my trip from nothing to, let's hope employability <br>
					(or the skill equivalent to obtaining it).
				</h2>
				
				<p>What's my plan? I'm using <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Java-Complete-Reference-Ninth-Edition/dp/0071808558">The Java Complete reference</a>
				   from front to back to learn Java. Why? The online tutorials, and other books don't do it for me. <br>
				   Starting from Part II, I'll work my way through the java library. I'll have two basic rules.
				   <ol>
					<li>I have to make a small program for each new concept I come across</li>
					<li>I have to make a second program using each new concept AND incorporate at least <br>
						the previous five concepts covered (if possible)</li>
				   </ol>
				   This page won't have fancy css, or particularly nice formating. it's here to hold links of my stages of learning. <br>
